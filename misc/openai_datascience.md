# Why might I thrive in this role?

## quantitative role navigating highly ambiguous environments

To launch a stuck AI feature I shifted a company's focus from data quantity to data quality, and started a quality control process, which included bringing in two new subject matter experts to help rewrite the ground truth.

## Defined, implemented, and operationalized new feature and product-level metrics from scratch

-   For a Tableau consumed API, I defined and implemented a new metric on map tile rendering.
-   I built the API observability framework that included customer usage and latency per query to prioritize product
    improvements.
-   For an internal scraping product I owned I proposed and built the first dashboard to track the health of data ingestion by company project.
-   I instrumented and created a company's first distributed tracing dashboard to help debug incidents and see bottlenecks.

## Strong programming background, with ability to run simulations and prototype variants

For my PhD research I ran Monte Carlo simulations to derive test statistics for a new human inequality measure.

Demonstrated prior experience in NLP, large language models, or generative AI

-   Now I am using an LLM to extract financial events from website for a Hedge Fund.
-   For my project Nobsmed.com, I use an LLM to extract health hack `actions` and `outcomes`.
-   For a gaming company, I developed a method of prompting for the LLM to generate murder mystery stories that
    were consistent with a means, motive, and opportunity premise.
-   For a legal billing analytics company I built a small language model to flag bad line item billing.
