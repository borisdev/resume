## Interesting activities

-   For my side-project, Nobsmed.com, I am making a website to help people compare their treatment options by summarizing clinical study outcomes along with Reddit personal experience anecdotal comments.
-   I climbed Cotopaxi (21,000 ft), survived bodyboarding Mexpipe, worked with students in Medellín, Columbia to make [ClusterPy](https://github.com/clusterpy/clusterpy), was a kids snowboard instructor at Vail Resorts, CO, was an assistant manager at Gundy's Grill in Vail Resorts, CO, was a counselor for severely emotionally disturbed children at Seneca Institute, CA.
