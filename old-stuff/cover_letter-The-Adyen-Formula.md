I have not had technical direct reports, but I have been a leader.

These parts of your job posting resonated with me:

- client first thinking and empathetic way of solving problems
- innovative, love dealing with ambiguity

I will bring agile engineering practices to analytics.

I read the Adyen Formula.

I strongly believe in ethics, launch fast and iterate, team work, direct
communication, being open-minded to all ideas, and autonomy.
