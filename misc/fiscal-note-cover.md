## How my experience aligns with the roleâ€™s requirements?

-   I have built LLM products from 0 to 1.

## What impact I feel I could have on the role?

My big impact will be in boosting collective creativity through my ability to synthesize through writing papers and merging ideas.
I believe joining cognitive empathy with the customer with tech takes a new approach and writing down our mental models of the story are a great way to do it.
The Amazon 6-pagers are examples of this approach.

This relates to what you wrote: "You habitually produce documentation to make it easy for others to understand your work."

Below is the evidence.

## What is my interest in joining FiscalNote?

I like your mission. You wrote "we combine expertise from technology and political science to build tools that foster transparency, drive informed decision-making, and enhance civic engagement." This overlaps a bit with my PhD research on new metrics for measuring human economic inequality in more nuanced ways by using public, geospatial data.
