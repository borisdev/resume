Mike Rubino
Promise Head of Talent

Dear Mike,

You asked me on Friday morning over video chat about AI Evaluation and then to email 
you a summary of what I am interested in for my next role.

## TLDR


- The short answer is I want to build RAGs in a role such as this one at [Promise Software Engineer -
AI](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Promise/4d2f9b56-1593-4b4f-b653-7d2ef7db0df5?utm_source=7nl8GjynMY).
- The long answer is I want to reduce human toil through Knowledge Engineering. 


## What is "Knowledge Engineering"? 

Knowledge Engineering builds software and human-in-the-loop processes to scale the answering of the following
questions in a reproducible way:

- How do we elicit knowledge and performance feedback from domain experts and customers? (For example, I embedded the elicitation of knowledge from lawyers and paralegals inside an active learning ML pipeline for fine-tuning the rubric and building hard training examples.)
- How do we quantify subjective concepts of quality and performance at scale?
(For example, I made an AI evaluation framework for email quality. Also, for my
PhD dissertation, I embedded nuanced ideas of income inequality into statistical
analysis.)
- How do we model entities of a niche domain human task to make an AI
prediction or extraction workflow? For example on worked on the following entity
types, which required fun deep dives into different niche domains:
  - legal billing flags for invalid invoice line items
  - earning call calendar events  
  - murder mystery story board scene cards
  - clinical study treatment effects
  - AI behavioral expectations and emails on handling supplier errors in the maritime construction industry 
  - AMD products in computer sales receipts

To recap, I would love to learn more about AI Engineering, AI Evaluation, or
Knowledge Engineering roles at Promise.


Sincerely,
Boris
