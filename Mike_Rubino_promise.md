Dear Mike,

Thanks again for the video chat on Friday. As requested, here’s a quick summary of what I’m interested in for my next role, and my resume is attached.


**TL;DR:** I’m looking for an AI role focused on knowledge engineering—building RAG systems (including evaluation) that reduce human toil. I applied to Software Engineer — AI at Promise. I am also curious about other roles.

**What is knowledge engineering about and how does it relate to me?**

Knowledge engineering is about answering the following questions in a
reproducible and scalable way:

* **How can we elicit knowledge and performance feedback from domain experts and customers?** For example, I embedded feedback from lawyers and paralegals into an active-learning ML pipeline to refine a rubric and generate hard training examples.
* **How can we quantify nuanced subjective concepts of quality to evaluate AI task performance?** For example, I built an AI evaluation framework for email quality. In my Ph.D. dissertation, I also embedded nuanced ideas of income inequality into statistical analysis.
* **How do wen build a prototype, 0→1 engineering, in messy niche domains?** The key is to quickly learn the domain, model the key concepts/entities, and then build the extraction/prediction pipeline on top of that. For example, I’ve built or worked on entity types such as:

  * legal billing flags for invalid invoice line items
  * earnings call calendar events
  * murder-mystery storyboard scene cards
  * clinical study treatment effects
  * AI behavioral expectations and email guidance for handling supplier errors in the maritime construction industry
  * AMD products in computer sales receipts

To recap, I’d love to learn more about AI engineering, AI evaluation, or knowledge engineering roles at Promise, and whether this maps to your current needs.

Sincerely,
Boris
