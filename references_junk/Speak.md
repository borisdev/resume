# Boris Dev

# Role: Speak, AI Product Engineer

## Reqs

Below I will outline where I intersect with your experience requirements.

-   10 years full stack/backend, product-focused software engineering
-   Strong in Python, Can handle TypeScript, JavaScript, and Node.js
-   For product innovation using the LLM, see my side-project Nobsmed.com.
-   Autonomy and ownership of projects: I have been a team lead. I have worked on greenfield projects.

## Tools

-   I am using OpenSearch as my vector search engine for Nobsmed.com. I experimented with Weavite.
-   I used LangSmith for evaluating the quality of the generated text for a small startup project.
-   I have also used sklearn for evaluation -- confusion matrix, classification report, etc.

## Ground Truth

Its true, the faster you can evaluate (read), the faster you can re-write.
However, if your Ground Truth is wrong then your evaluation is wrong. The
evaluation and re-writing process is meaningless if you don't have a good
Ground Truth data set and even better mental model (ideally documented). I
believe what people miss is the issue of getting better and better Ground
Truth. This is hard. Getting better Ground Truth requires collective creativity
and debates. I have worked successfully on this issue as a leader.
