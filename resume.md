## Job experience

### Data Science Engineer consultant at SimpleLegal, 2022-2023

SimpleLegal is a legal billing analytics company. 

Before I arrived, my employer's new language
AI feature for flagging suspicious invoice lines was stuck for one year
because of bad performance, even after investing in more human annotation. My
job was to increase AI performance. The result was we launched the AI feature and won an [AI Excellence Award](https://www.bintelligence.com/blog/2023/3/23/5-people-30-companies-and-65-products-awarded-for-excellence-in-artificial-intelligence). 

I changed the direction from data quantity to data quality.

- I asked the President to convene an Amazon 6-pager meeting to share the results of the gathering mission, outlined below. 
- I built relationships with five experts across the conglomerate.
- The annotation expert opened my eyes to treat the offshore annotators as
  creative partners. Success depended on getting their feedback for the continuous improvement of 
  the annotation guidelines and AI flag definitions.
- I nudged the data scientists to articulate the biggest issue as _"garbage in, garbage out"_.
- I connected with a Founder (VP of Product) at a sister company who translated for me the customer meaning behind the legal invoice line-item data.

I managed the offshore annotators.

- I included the offshore annotators and subject-matter expert into a continuous
  improvement collaboration on AI flag definition and annotation guidelines.
- I changed the annotation process to small batches
- I started inter-annotator performance metrics and reviews.
- To build cognitive empathy, I labeled several hundred sentences. As a result,
  I identified convoluted annotation guidelines as the root cause of our poor
  labeling quality.


I led the Senior Data Scientist and the subject-matter expert.

- I added the subject-matter expert to our team.
- The technical vision I set for the data scientist and I was to launch an MVP
  in six months by discovering "low-hanging fruit" that could scale back the
  machine learning effort. This resulted in scaling back our machine learning
  from eleven to three redefined classifiers. The triage was to kill one
  classifier that was never needed, replace two with expert rules, and stop the
  labeling on five whose performance was sufficient. 
- To increase clarity, I coached the team to understand the customer meaning
  behind the data and the AI flags.
- To increase clarity, I crunched the knowledge of the Data Scientist's metrics
  analysis into a working paper, which was continually shared at the weekly
  check-ins. 
- I wrote the data scientist a stellar performance review, highlighting his
  acumen at articulating complex concepts to executives.

I led the engineering tasks.

- I assigned Jira issues to engineers. 
- 1:1 meetings with the VP of Engineering. 
- After one engineer left for another company, I stepped in to refactor the
  inference server.


### Lead Analytic Endpoint Engineer at Sight Machine, 2018-2021

Sight Machine is a manufacturing analytics company.

- To get the company's biggest public-facing feature,
  [Recipes](https://sightmachine.com/blog/manufacturing-dynamic-recipes/),
  across the GA line, I worked across silos (Customer Success, DevOps, Data
  Engineers). I wrote high-level design papers to help the Product and Customer Success
  teams understand the time cost of competing technical design decisions, arming them with
  a conceptual framework to gather more information from the customer on her
  priorities.
- I started a new checklist process to lock down successful sales demos.
- I nudged the engineering team to move from a delivery team to a product
  team. The Director of Engineering and I started a new process where the
  engineers fleshed out their own Jira issues. The new technical design autonomy
  reduced engineering toil and increased creativity.
- I built the first distributed tracing (Lightstep), which made debugging system
  downtime easier. 
- I proposed and delivered a new standardized frontend development environment. The innovation made debugging and on-boarding easier.
- I coached junior engineers in systems thinking.

### Lead Data Engineer at HiQ Labs, 2015-2018

HiQ Labs was a people analytics company. 


- I led the move from a monolith to a microservice paradigm. I led a Data
  Engineer to guide the Data Scientists to refactor each component of their monolith 
  into a docker container service. I explained to management the technical and human vision behind the
  microservice paradigm. 
- I owned the scraping part of the pipeline. The puzzle for the CTO and I was to figure out how to get around LinkedIn’s bot
  detection in order to scrape millions of HTML public profiles, the raw data
  for our prediction pipeline. 
- I led a Junior DevOps engineer to build a Splunk observability system that was
  used to track performance and experiments on different spider configurations. 
- I trained a Junior Data Engineer to maintain the scraping system.
- I shadowed the Data Scientists to see what I could
  automate for them.
- I migrated the Data Scientists from Mongo queries to PySpark.

### Start-up partner and full-stack developer at Map Decisions, 2014

Map Decisions was an asset management company for city Public Works departments.

- I built a mobile app to automate street sign inspection.

### Start-up partner and analytics developer at Geoscore, 2014

Geoscore was a company for demographic analytics.

- I made the analytic endpoints.
- I ran Google Ad experiments around comparing SEO strategies.


### Developer at Urban Mapping, 2011-2013

Urban Mapping provided geospatial analytics to Tableau. 

- I created KPIs.
- I built the CI pipeline (Jenkins).
- I built the observability system (Splunk, Tableau BI Dashboard).

## Misc leadership roles


- I gave technical vision to students in Medellín, Columbia to make [ClusterPy](https://github.com/clusterpy/clusterpy).
- I coached graduate students and taught spatial statistics, as a PhD.
- Kids snowboard instructor at Vail Resorts, CO.
- Restaurant Assistant Manager at Vail Resorts, CO.
- Lead analyst at California Business Magazine. CA. 
- Counselor for emotionally disturbed children. Seneca Institute. CA.
