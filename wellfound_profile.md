Give me the following:

-   Hard AI-LLM product quality problems: The ones other engineers already got stuck on
-   Space for analysis time: for conceptual domain models, probing customer questions, and Amazon 6-pager reports
-   Freedom to move swim lanes: to be both a data science and engineer and to optimize cross-silo processes
-   Autonomy: to own projects end-to-end and make impactful decisions
