## About the Role

At OpenAI, we're dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence, and we know that creating a secure and reliable platform is vital to our mission. That's why we're seeking a software engineer to help us build out our trust and safety capabilities.

In this role, you'll work with our entire engineering team to design and implement systems that detect and prevent abuse, promote user safety, and reduce risk across our platform. You'll be at the forefront of our efforts to ensure that the immense potential of AI is harnessed in a responsible and sustainable manner.

In this role, you will:

Architect, build, and maintain anti-abuse and content moderation infrastructure designed to protect us and end users from unwanted behavior.
Work closely with our other engineers and researchers to utilize both industry standard and novel AI techniques to combat abuse and toxic content.
Assist with response to active incidents on the platform and build new tooling and infrastructure that address the fundamental problems.
You might thrive in this role if you:

Have at least 3 years of professional software engineering experience.
Have experience setting up and maintaining production backend services and data pipelines.
Have a humble attitude, an eagerness to help your colleagues, and a desire to do whatever it takes to make the team succeed.
Are self-directed and enjoy figuring out the best way to solve a particular problem
Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done.
Care about AI Safety in production environments and have the expertise to build software systems that defend against abuse.
Build tools to accelerate your own workflows, but only when off-the-shelf solutions would not do.
Our tech stack

Our infrastructure is built on Terraform, Kubernetes, Azure, Python, Postgres, and Kafka. While we value experience with these technologies, we are primarily looking for engineers with strong technical skills and the ability to quickly pick up new tools and frameworks.

## What is your most significant technical achievement?

I reduced LLM hallucination on math word problems by adding causal structure to the PAL (Program-aided Language) approach.
Where can we find samples of your code?
Coding samples increase the amount of information we can review for your application.

## Tell us more about what teams or types of projects you're interested in.

I want to touch these four components of the project puzzle.

1. defining the human problem
2. refining our model of the human problem (data science)
3. building the tool to fix the human problem (engineering)
4. evaluating where our tools and models fall short (observability) 

I wish to work on a project where I can make a measurable impact. 

Ideally, I am working backwards from first building cognitive empathy with the customer, then building conceptual models to share with my team, then building software, and lastly, building observability tools to measure the success of the software.

I wish to work on a team with a creative collective spirit and a practical spirit.
