## 0 to 1

I can launch new products. Below is evidence of my ability to do so:

-   I developed a new prompting method for AI story generation for Law and Order's startup in time for their launch.
-   I shifted a team's focus to data quality from quantity and did triage to get a stuck ML feature launched.
-   I coordinated triage with customer support, while engineering the backend, to launch the biggest customer facing feature.
-   I took the lead to train data scientists to launch a new microservice pipeline.
-   I am excited about the greenfield opportunity - I have fun at building things from scratch in states of high ambiguity.
-   I do blocker removal by working across silos!
