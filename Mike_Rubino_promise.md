Mike Rubino
Head of Talent, Promise

Dear Mike,

Thanks again for the video chat on Friday. As requested, here’s a quick summary of what I’m interested in for my next role, and my resume is attached.

**TL;DR:** I’m looking for an AI engineering role where I can build RAG systems and evaluation/feedback loops that reduce human toil.

**A bit more detail (what I mean by “knowledge engineering”):** I like building software plus human-in-the-loop processes that make it reproducible to:

* **Elicit knowledge and performance feedback from domain experts and customers.** For example, I embedded feedback from lawyers and paralegals into an active-learning ML pipeline to refine a rubric and generate hard training examples.
* **Quantify subjective concepts of quality and performance at scale.** For example, I built an AI evaluation framework for email quality. In my Ph.D. dissertation, I also operationalized nuanced ideas of income inequality for statistical analysis.
* **Do 0→1 engineering in messy domains.** I quickly learn the domain, model the key concepts/entities, and then build the extraction/prediction pipeline on top of that. For example, I’ve built or worked on entity types such as:

  * legal billing flags for invalid invoice line items
  * earnings call calendar events
  * murder-mystery storyboard scene cards
  * clinical study treatment effects
  * AI behavioral expectations and email guidance for handling supplier errors in the maritime construction industry
  * AMD products in computer sales receipts

To recap, I’d love to learn more about AI engineering, AI evaluation, or knowledge engineering roles at Promise, and whether this maps to your current needs.

Sincerely,
Boris
