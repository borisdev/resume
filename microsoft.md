# Boris Dev's AI Product Engineer Cover Letter

Below is a short list of rationales on why I believe you should consider me for
the AI Product Engineer role.

## I build developer-first products, for example:

-   APIs by collaborating with front-end developer customers
-   Automated performance testing tools for backend developers
-   Several observability dashboards for monitoring and debugging
-   I did the training and ops support for data scientists to move to pyspark and deploy to microservices

## I love working in cross-functional teams, for example:

-   I am an engineer who got a PhD in Human Geography, and loves working with data scientists so I can see the big picture.
