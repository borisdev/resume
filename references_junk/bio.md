To increase the quality of software answer generation and search results, Boris
integrates specialized human domain knowledge with language AI software
systems. This requires formalizing specialized human domain languages, which
include causal relations. His applications of this are in searching for
semiconductor products, searching for clinical study research papers,
generating murder mystery gaming events, and an open source experimental
contribution to Langchain's library. Boris's recent work experience is with
startups and it intersects distributed systems engineering, data science, and
language. Boris's start with data science was during his PhD research in Human
Geography, focusing on human inequality metrics.
