# # Boris Dev's application for Staff Data Scientist at Fastly

Below I address each point in the section of your job posting,
_"Weâ€™ll be super impressed if you have experience in one or more of these"_.

_Domain expertise in our industry or related fields_

-   Related to Fastly tools to block scraping, I was in charge of getting around
    LinkedIn's bot detection system. I built a distributed scraper that downloaded
    million's of LinkedIn profiles for ingestion into a ML training pipeline.

_Experience deploying and maintaining production machine learning systems_

-   At a legal tech company, I deployed their first AI classifier model to flag
    problem invoice line items on AWS SageMaker. I also built a human
    annotation pipeline to label, wrote the annotation guidelines, and trained
    the annotators, coordinated the subject matter experts, and changed the
    direction of the project.
-   I migrated a team from a monolith to a microservice ML pipeline. I also added
    the company's observability system to monitor the ML pipeline.

_Track record of leading technical teams or mentoring junior data scientists_

-   I trained data scientists in PySpark and DataBricks..
-   I trained data scientists to convert their monolith code into deployable microservices.

_Building AI-powered products_ and _"Building AI-powered products or features that have been successfully deployed to end users"_

"Implementing and fine-tuning large language models or other generative AI systems for specific business applications"

-   I deployed an AI feature to users that had previously been stuck for a year before my arrival.
-   My side-project, Nobsmed.com, is a generative AI product that extracts
    semantic meaning of health interventions from clinical studies and Reddit
    posts for users to search and explore other people's health hacking experiences.

-   For my PhD dissertation, I formulated metrics that leverage the special nature of geospatial data.

-   My side-project, Nobsmed.com, is a generative AI product that extracts
    semantic meaning of health interventions from clinical studies and Reddit
    posts for users to search and explore other people's health hacking experiences.

_"Experience with prompt engineering and RAG systems"_

-   For a Wolf Games, a murder mystery gaming company, I built their first
    story generation service using a automated DAG prompting with generative
    AI.
-   For my business side-project, Nobsmed.com, I use generative AI to extract
    semantic meaning of health interventions from clinical studies and Reddit
    posts that are indexed into a RAG system.

_"Contributions to open-source AI projects or research publications in machine learning or generative AI"_

-   For the Langchain open-source library, I contributed an experimental way to
    create dynamic causal knowledge graphs ([Tweet by LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1678797225013440514) and the [PR](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/6255)
-   My opensource library [bertopic-easy](https://github.com/borisdev/bertopic-easy) is quick way to cluster documents into topics that leverages OpenAI's cutting edge o3-mini LLM model to polish embedding based cluster results.

_"Proficiency with AI services on cloud platforms (AWS Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI)"_

-   I work with Azure's OpenAI services.
