# Cover letter for Boris Dev for Software Engineer position at Astra

I can build data tools by moving backwards from finding the key stakeholder and
asking about the nature of their unanswered questions. Examples of this type of
entrepreneurial work include:

-   I have proposed, designed, and built observability tools for engineering teams.
-   I have re-built the development environment for a 5 front-end developers team.
-   I have built business analytics tools for execs.

I am ready for cross-functional team work, for example:

-   I have experience right in the middle of product, data science, and engineering.
-   I have worked with professors, corporate VPs, startup founders, you data scientists, and engineers.
-   I have created new work processes for better collaboration.
-   I have supported the data science teams with data pipelines.

On the technical side:

-   I am strong in Python.
-   TypeScript is no problem for me since I have experience with AngularJS.
-   I am getting my head around Go -- excited to learn more about Go Routines and Channels.

Sincerely,
Boris Dev
