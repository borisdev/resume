Dear Mike,

Thanks again for the video chat on Friday. It was great chatting a bit about AI evaluation.

As you requested, here’s a quick summary of what I’m interested in for my next role, and my resume is attached.

**TL;DR:**

- I want to build RAG systems. I applied to the Software Engineer — AI role at Promise.
- More broadly, I want to reduce human toil through knowledge engineering.

**What is knowledge engineering about and how does it relate to me?**

Knowledge engineering is about answering the following questions in a
reproducible and scalable way:

* **How can we elicit knowledge and performance feedback from domain experts and customers?** For example, I worked with lawyers and paralegals to refine our annotation rubric—facilitating Slack discussions and using an active-learning pipeline to surface progressively harder examples.
* **How can we embed nuanced, subjective concepts of quality into scalable, reproducible evaluation?** For example, I built an AI evaluation framework for email quality. Also, for my Ph.D. research, I embedded nuanced ideas of income inequality into statistical analysis.
* **How can we do 0→1 engineering in messy niche domains?** For example, I built 0→1 software by modeling entity types across diverse niche domains:

  * legal billing flags for invalid invoice line items
  * earnings call calendar events
  * murder-mystery storyboard scene cards
  * clinical study treatment effects
  * AI behavioral expectations and email guidance for handling supplier errors in the maritime construction industry

To recap, I’d love to chat with your team about RAG engineering, AI evaluation, and knowledge engineering roles at Promise.

Sincerely,
Boris
