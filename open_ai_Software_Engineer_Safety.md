## What is your most significant technical achievement?

I reduced LLM hallucination on math word problems by adding causal structure to
the PAL (Program-aided Language) approach. 


## Where can we find samples of your code?

https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/6255


## Tell us more about what teams or types of projects you're interested in.

I am interested in working on project where I can leverage my knack for
attacking ambiguous problems, which often demand synthesizing across knowledge silos. 

I want to work on projects where I can touch these four parts of the puzzle.

1. defining the human problem
2. refining our model of the human problem (data science)
3. building the tool to fix the human problem (engineering)
4. evaluating where our tools and models fall short (observability) 


I am interested in projects where we can begin by working backwards from
building cognitive empathy with the customer in order to correctly understand
the problem. Then, we can build conceptual models so the team can move forward as
one. Then, of course, its time to roll up our sleeves and build software. This
includes a reality check by building observability tools to measure the
success of the software.

I wish to work on a team with a creative collective spirit and a practical spirit. 


## Additional Information

*Cognitive empathy with the enemy, and my scraper*

Perhaps as important as building cognitive empathy with the customer is building
cognitive empathy with the enemy, in order to circumvent him. I have an
interesting edge here since I built the scraper system than successfully
circumvented LinkedIn's bot detection system (this ended with a Supreme Court
Case, HiQ vs LinkedIn).

*Motivation*

OpenAI wants to monitor and detect abuse. Likewise, during my PhD research I
formulated a metric to detect unfairness in the design of school attendance zones
boundaries. Since then I have built observability systems to detect system and
customer problems. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to work at OpenAI
as Software Engineer, Safety. This job combines my engineering experience and
desire to build tools to help humanity.


## Where can we learn more about you?

1. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-dev/.     2. Papers: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMID97O4hHkK8ok7cwLH4Y4KpsgQSPUAXtYrscwcyb4/edit


## Please provide an example or evidence of your exceptional ability.

*Top example*

My top example is my Causal program-aided language (CPAL) chain, which is a new LLM chain approach to reduce hallucination (https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/6255).


*Four other technical achievements*

In addition to my LangChain CPAL contribution that I mentioned above, below are
four other achievements.

1. At an earlier phase in the movement, I led the migration of my team's data
  pipeline to a microservice architecture.

2. I built a scraper system than successfully circumvented LinkedIn's bot
  detection system.

3. I brought the biggest public facing feature of my last
  company, from its embryonic phase as a spreadsheet to general audience.

4. At my last gig, I deployed the company's 1st AI feature, which had been stuck
   for a year before I arrived. Here is an article I wrote based on my experience on this project:

Without cognitive empathy, your language AI appâ€™s performance metrics are meaningless
