## Notable success

-   For a legal ops company, I discovered their training data was wrong and rebuilt their ground truth as a team effort to launch a new language AI billing feature.
-   For a gaming startup, I designed and built their murder mystery story generation service, starting from a greenfield design of the primitives.
-   For a semiconductor analytics startup, I designed a new computer name disambiguation approach for AMD's sale analytics pipeline.
-   For the Langchain open-source library, I contributed an experimental [CPAL Chain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/6255) - first causal LLM chain. [Tweet by LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1678797225013440514).
-   For a people an startup, new microservice paradigm.
-   For academics, new location based human inequality metrics in [Assessing Inequality using Geographic Income Distributions](https://escholarship.org/content/qt8br7d5df/qt8br7d5df.pdf)
-   For several companies, I built observability systems.
