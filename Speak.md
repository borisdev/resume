-   Yes, autonomy and speed are key: Ability to work independently and build at a high velocity
-   Yes, see my side-project Nobsmed.com on "Interest in building with LLMs"
-   I am using OpenSearch as my search engine for Nobsmed.com. I experimented with Weavite.

-   I have also used sklearn for evaluation -- confusion matrix, classification report, etc.

## Ground Truth

At the end of the day, the faster you can evaluate (read) the faster you can
re-write. But the evaluation and re-writing process is meaningless if you don't
have a good Ground Truth.

I believe what people miss is the issue of getting better and better Ground
Truth. This is hard. If your Ground Truth is wrong then your evaluation is
wrong. Getting better Ground Truth requires collective creativity and debates.
I have worked successfully on this issue as a leader.
