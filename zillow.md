## Distilling Zillow's 8 Core Values into three parts

1. The view - Purpose - customer
2. The practice - have an open state of mind - put on the light - use all information

  a. balance - trilemna - speed, quality, ethics
  b. balance - autonomy, interdependence, individuality 
  


## Two phase history of product

Customer journey starts with the Home search and ends with closing.

- Phase 1:  Zestimate real estate prediction valuation service. 
- Phase 2 (now):  real estate transaction service

# Distilling interview with Jonathon

## Applied data scientist build the prediction services ingested by product engineering

## Data scientists bespoke forecasting, analysis, and EDA for business decisions

- tools: Snowflake and Looker, pre-canned SQL queries into models that make metrics....organize this

## Continuous improvement on Business goals

- high conversion rates
- predict high propensity to close contacts
- use customer behavior on site to predict propensity to close
- track follow-up of agent
- observability of customer experience on the site

## Depends on automation of analytics team processes

## How analytics team fits into bigger picture of continuous improvement

- Growth ie. Growth hacking experiments
- Data driven product development, What's the next thing to make, What the smallest next intervention
- depends on forming a collective causal mental model, iteratively  
- depends on observability or measurements to analyze, reports
- depends on instrumentation
- depends on domain modeling -- mental models of stakeholders
  - what are product analysts looking for?
  - what are business analysts looking for?
