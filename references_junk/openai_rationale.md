Software Engineer, Full Stack (People Innovation)

I can build your people analytics software. Below is my rationale.

Rationale 1: I love people analytics and have academic credentials

Building HR people analytics software is a type of social science research and writing project. I have experience with this type of social science research work. For example, for my PhD, I wrote code for some new geospatial human inequality metrics and wrote a dissertation documenting these metrics.

Rationale 2: I build people analytics software

I have experience building people analytics software for tech. At HiQ Labs, a people analytics and HR company, I was responsible for scraping and parsing LinkedIn profiles. I supported the data science team with their source training data, innovated their training pipeline (monolith to microservices), started the first observability system, and contributed to product ideas to the CEO. For example, here is a Sankey Plot data viz which helped us sell to the Pharma industry for their recruiting, https://drive.google.com/file/d/19vcrXbdyFbHpPTkGy7_8qN_ZZs65UCxG/view) .

Rationale 3: I can innovate of LLM tooling

I love to innovate on how we apply LLMs. For example, here is Langchain's tweet about my experimental contribution of a chain that discovers causal structure: https://x.com/LangChainAI/status/1678797225013440514. As another example of my LLM innovation work, at Wolf Games, I designed and wrote their production murder mystery story generator using a causal DAG. My final example of LLM work, is at my startup, Nobsmed.com, where I am using the LLM to parse biohacks out of academic studies and Reddit posts.

Rationale 4: I can build a product from scratch

I can own the full product development lifecycle. I excel at making fast prototypes because of my generalist end-to-end background. For example, at SimpleLegal a legal-ops tech company, to launch a previously stuck AI feature I did the following work. I ran data science evaluation metrics and reports. I managed human annotators. I trained a pytorch transformer model. I wrote a Amazon 6-pager for a exec meeting. I diagnosed the data quality issue. I deployed a model on a SageMaker server endpoint. I ingested the model's prediction endpoint the webserver product.

Another example of building a product from scratch is Nobsmed.com. Here I also did customer problem discovery. My work on Wolf Game's murder mystery story generator was also greenfield work that started with papers and talks with the CTO and ended with me deploying a production microservice.
