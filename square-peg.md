I am an AI product engineer with special talent in high ambiguity problems.

I am a generalist with a wide range of experience such as in data science, observability for SRE, ETL, and web backend. Being a generalist means I can make an AI web product end to end. For example, I can do the following:

Problem discovery (internal tooling or external feature)
Clarify and reduce scope
Build a quick prototype to get feedback
Living document on Ground Truth
ML train
ETL pipes (including web scraping)
Web API Framework
HTMX/HTML/CSS/Web Geo mapping/Data Viz
Deploy to AWS app runner, manage compose files
Observability - tracing, metrics and analytics
